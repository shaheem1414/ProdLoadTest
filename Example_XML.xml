			<title>Rose Golden 50th Wedding Anniver. 4L pot </title>
			<description>A perfect gift to celebrate any couple reaching their momentous Golden Wedding Anniversary, marking 50 years of marriage. This spectacular rose offers great pleasure for many years to come.Beautiful and rounded, deep golden-yellow blooms burst from dark and glossy green foliage across the warm months of summer, even into the first weeks of autumn.What's more, each bloom produces a lovely sweet scent which delights the senses without overwhelming other natural perfumes.'Golden Wedding' boasts a healthy and strong growth habit, and is repeat-flowering for prolonged garden interest. The perfect present for someone special, it will brighten up their garden for years and constantly remind them of their special day, each time the blooms emerge.Supplied freshly in a 4 litre pot, ready to be planted out.We always endeavour to provide beautifully formed plants; however, our roses will naturally start to lose their leaves from October to prepare for the colder months. Do not worry though, as they will flourish once again with leaves and buds in the spring. Please, make sure you consider the season when purchasing our remarkable roses for yourself or loved ones. </description>
